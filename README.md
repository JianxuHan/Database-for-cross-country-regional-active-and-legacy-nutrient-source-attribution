This dataset contains nutrient concentration (TN/NH3-N, TP) and water discharge data from Australia, China, Sweden, and the USA.   
Each country's data is organized into subfolders based on the respective country.

Data Sources:  
The data were collected from water quality monitoring agencies, research institutions, and public data sources in each respective country. The data sources for each country are as follows:   
    Australia: Retrieved from https://data.water.vic.gov.au/.  
    China: Retrieved from the Ministry of Ecology and Environment of the People's Republic of China (nutrient concentration) and the Hydrological Year Book (water discharge).  
 USA: Retrieved from https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7433379.  
    Sweden: Retrieved from https://doi.org/10.5066/P948Z0VZ.

Data Formats and contents:  
The data in each subfolder are stored in TXT or Excel formats.  
TXT Files: These files are named by monitor station ID and include monitor time, nutrient data, water discharge data, and corresponding units.  
Excel Files: These files contain information about the location of the monitoring stations and maps of the catchment areas.

To align with the source data, please be aware that the units for nutrient concentration and water discharge data may vary for each country.
